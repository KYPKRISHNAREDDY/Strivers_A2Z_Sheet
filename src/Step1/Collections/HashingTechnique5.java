            Each Entry in HashTable is called Bucket.
            As You insert ,HashTable size will keep on increasing in OpenAddressing mode.
            We use hashFunc  to store the values and we use same function to retrive the value back

-ways to store keys:OpenAddressing,Chaining

Handling Collision in Open Addressing
